# Amnesia
CSCE 445 Term Project

Amnesia is an interactive browser-based story game where the user makes decisions that ultimately affect the outcome.

## How to Run

For this current working version:

```
$ python run.py
```

Note that you must install dependencies (see below) and compile the frontend (see the `README` file in the frontend directory) before the game will run and work.

## Virtual Environment
It's suggested to run the server in a virtual environment. If you want to use a virtual environment, set it up through the [usual ways](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/), then activate the environment. Install dependencies and then run the app.

## Dependencies
Install all required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
